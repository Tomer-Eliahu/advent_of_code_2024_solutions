//Part 1 solution notes:
//Account for cycles.
//Seems like a shortest-path graph problem.
//Best path minimizes turns (as we know the input map is about 140 by 140
//so 1 additional turn would result in a bigger score for sure).
//So maybe run ahead in a straight line as much as possible, marking all nodes where you can turn (also make sure
//to mark the directions we can turn; i.e. if we can just turn right or both right and left),
//then also marking visited nodes to avoid cycles and cut paths that are longer to get to the same location.
//Need to keep 2 counters: one of steps taken, one of turns taken.
//Running ahead in a straight line as much as possible modifies BFS to minimize turns instead of steps taken.
//Also need to made sure when marking the map, to mark the minimum score to get to that location to know which path
//to cut.
//Do modified BFS with counter of turns taken and know that once 1 road ended to just exhaust
//all other queued-up potential paths with the same number of turns.
//Also note it is enough to just mark places we turn instead of every node (+ mark end node and start nodes as well).
//If we merge all nodes we get to after X turns before starting X+1 turns we can cut paths.
//Can use Hashmap with node: (turn-counter, step-counter) [instead of the score]
//and sets (instead of queues) with (node, direction to head to).
//Can use 2 sets (one we exhaust, and one where we load up (node, direction to go).
